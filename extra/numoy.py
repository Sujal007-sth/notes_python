#numpy is faster than list as it uses less bytes of memory, used for matrix calc, scientific reserch and it is a library, to bring numpy in my system first i do pip install numpy and then import
#numpy is a library
#deosnt check 
#2d array = 2 ta list vako lai its called 2d array
#eg = ([1,2,3],[5,7,8]) or [[1,2,3,5,7,8]]
#to see dimension of array = get dimension(a.ndim) is used
#shape = 
#for knowing data type = get data type
#numpy helps in making matrix'
#how to make array = 

#linespace() 
# x = linespace(2,3,num=5) 2 and 3 are range
#a = [1,2]
#a = b
# a→[1,2]← b both are pointing to the same memory location
#flatten = makes 2d array in 1 (having only one row)
#reshape =
